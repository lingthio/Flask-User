Customizable User Account Management for Flask
----------------------------------------------

| So you're writing a Flask web application and would like to authenticate your users.
| You start with a simple **Login** page, but soon enough you need to handle:

* **Registrations** and **Email Confirmations**
* **Change Usernames**, **Change Passwords**, and **Forgotten Passwords**

And wouldn't it be nice to also offer:

* **Role-based Authorization**
* **Remember-me cookies**
* **Multiple emails per user**
* **Internationalization**

| Flask-User offers these user features (and more) out-of-the-box
| while also honoring the following developer needs:

* **Reliable** (Code coverage of over 95%)
* **Secure** (Built on top of widely deployed Flask-Login)
* **Ready to use** (Through sensible defaults)
* **Largely configurable** (Through configuration settings)
* **Fully customizable** (Through customizable functions and email templates)
* **Well documented**
* **Tested on Python 2.6, 2.7, 3.3 and 3.4**

Status
------

| Flask-User v0.5 and v0.6 are quite stable and is used in production environments.
| It is marked as a Beta release because the API is subject to small changes.
| We appreciate it if you would enter issues and
  enhancement requests into the `Flask-User Issue Tracker <https://github.com/lingthio/flask-user/issues>`_.
