User Authentication and Management
----------------------------------
| So, you're writing a Flask web application and would like to authenticate your users.
| You start with a simple **Login** page, but soon enough you'll need to handle:

* **Registrations** and **Email Confirmations**
* **Change Usernames**, **Change Passwords**, and **Forgotten Passwords**

And wouldn't it be nice to also offer:

* **Added Security**
* **Increased Reliability**
* **Role-based Authorization**
* **Internationalization** (Chinese, Dutch, English, Farsi, Finnish, French, German, Italian, Russian, Spanish, Swedish, and Turkish)


Customizable, yet Ready to use
------------------------------
* **Largely Configurable** -- By overriding configuration settings.
* **Fully Customizable** -- By overriding methods and properties.
* **Ready to use** -- Through sensible defaults.
* Supports **SQL** and **MongoDB** databases.
